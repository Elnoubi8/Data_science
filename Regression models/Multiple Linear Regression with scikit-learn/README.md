this project-based course on Linear Regression with NumPy and Python. 
In this project do all the machine learning without using any of the popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn and statsmodels
the aim to implement all the machinery of the various algorithms from scratch to have a deeper understanding of the fundamentals .
Compute the Cost ,Implement the gradient descent algorithm from scratch using python ,Visualizing the Cost Function , Plotting the Convergence 
,Training Data with Univariate Linear Regression Fit,Inference using the optimized ùúÉ values
